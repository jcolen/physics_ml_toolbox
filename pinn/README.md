This directory contains implementations of the following algorithms:

- [Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125)
- [Variational PINNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00873)

These algorithms are tested using datasets provided alongside each paper. I also include additional examples using data generated from numerical fluids solvers. Eventually, I will expand this repository to include methods for solving equations and that code will be available locally.
