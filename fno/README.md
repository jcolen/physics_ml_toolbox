Using Burgers' equation and Darcy flow datasets from their [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnbQh2WWc6knEHbLn-ZaXrKUZhp7pjt-). This data is too big to git-track but you can download it, extract it, and point the data_processing scripts to the correct locations by modifying the configuration files.
